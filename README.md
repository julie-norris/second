verygoodsecurity.py is my solution to the Technical Support online HackerRank challenge

The code is imcomplete and errors out when run.
The skeleton of the app is in place and correct, but the connection to VGS and the tokenization of the data is not functioning currently.
With more time, I can make it function properly.

Thank you for the opportunity.
